Columbia Data Analytics and Visualization Bootcamp Module 4: Pandas Challenge


The Python code I've written here uses pandas library to analyze and process data related to district and charter school spending and size compared to their math and reading percentage passing. 

This project aims to use calculations which are then added to data frames to draw conclusions on the data that allow us to figure out what further datapoints we would need to cement our initial hypothesis about what must be altered in these schools.
